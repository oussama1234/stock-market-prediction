# News-Driven Predictions System - Implementation Status

## Date: October 14, 2025

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1. News Storage with Stock Association
- ‚úÖ `news_articles` table has all required fields (stock_id, published_at, sentiment_score)
- ‚úÖ Updated `FetchNewsArticlesJob` to save articles to database
- ‚úÖ Articles are stored with stock_id linking them to specific stocks
- ‚úÖ Sentiment analysis job dispatched automatically after fetching

### 2. Keyword-Based Sentiment Analysis
- ‚úÖ `AnalyzeNewsSentimentJob` has comprehensive keyword detection
- ‚úÖ Bullish keywords: "AI chip deal", "stock soars", "surge", "rally", "rebound" (weights: +6 to +9)
- ‚úÖ Bearish keywords: "crash", "plunge", "tariff", "downgrade" (weights: -6 to -9)
- ‚úÖ Sentiment scores stored as decimal (-10 to +10 range)
- ‚úÖ Rebound pattern detection integrated

### 3. API Endpoints for News with Sentiment
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/stocks/{symbol}/news` - Recent news from database
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/stocks/{symbol}/news/today` - Today's news with aggregate sentiment
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/stocks/{symbol}/news/fetch` - Fetch and store fresh news

### 4. Verified Working
**Test Results for AVGO:**
- Fetched: 20 articles
- Stored: 30 articles (including historical)
- Today's articles: 8
- Average sentiment: +0.1375 (slightly bullish)
- Bullish: 5, Bearish: 1, Neutral: 2

## üöß IN PROGRESS / TODO

### 5. Integrate News Sentiment into Prediction Model
**Current Status:** News sentiment is calculated but not yet factored into prediction scoring

**What Needs to be Done:**
1. Modify `PredictionService::prepareStockData()` to include today's news sentiment
2. Add field: `today_news_sentiment` to the data passed to Python model
3. Update Python `quick_model_v4.py` to use `today_news_sentiment` as additive factor
4. Weight it appropriately (suggested: 10-15% of final score)

**Implementation Plan:**
```php
// In PredictionService::prepareStockData()
$todayNews = $stock->newsArticles()
    ->where('published_at', '>=', now()->startOfDay())
    ->whereNotNull('sentiment_score')
    ->get();

$todayNewsSentiment = $todayNews->avg('sentiment_score') ?? 0;
$todayNewsCount = $todayNews->count();

$data['today_news_sentiment'] = $todayNewsSentiment;
$data['today_news_count'] = $todayNewsCount;
```

```python
# In Python quick_model_v4.py predict() method
today_news_sentiment = features.get('today_news_sentiment', 0)
today_news_count = features.get('today_news_count', 0)

# Add news sentiment as additive factor (10% weight)
if today_news_count > 0:
    news_contribution = (today_news_sentiment / 10) * 0.10  # Normalize and weight
    final_score += news_contribution
```

### 6. Add Technical Analytics to Prediction
**Current Status:** Technical indicators calculated but not explicitly shown in breakdown

**What Needs to be Done:**
1. Extract technical indicator contributions from `indicators_snapshot`
2. Add detailed breakdown showing:
   - RSI contribution (+/- score)
   - MACD contribution
   - Bollinger Bands position
   - Volume analysis
   - Support/Resistance levels
3. Include in prediction response with individual weights

### 7. Enhance PredictionCardV2 Display
**Current Status:** Basic prediction display without detailed breakdown

**What Needs to be Added:**
1. **News Sentiment Section:**
   - Display today's news articles (top 5-10)
   - Show individual sentiment scores
   - Aggregate sentiment score with visual indicator
   - Contribution to final prediction (+X% or -X%)

2. **Technical Analytics Section:**
   - RSI indicator with visual gauge
   - MACD histogram
   - Bollinger Bands position
   - Volume vs Average
   - Each with contribution score

3. **Factor Breakdown Card:**
   ```
   Prediction Breakdown:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Asian Markets: -0.63 (20% weight) ‚Üí -0.126
   ‚îú‚îÄ European Markets: -0.10 (30% weight) ‚Üí -0.030
   ‚îú‚îÄ Local Sentiment: +0.01 (50% weight) ‚Üí +0.005
   ‚îú‚îÄ Today's News: +0.14 (10% additive) ‚Üí +0.014
   ‚îú‚îÄ Technical: RSI=56.7 ‚Üí Neutral
   ‚îî‚îÄ Final Score: -0.15 ‚Üí BEARISH -2.37%
   ```

### 8. Schedule Regular News Fetching
**Current Status:** Jobs exist but not scheduled

**What Needs to be Done:**
Add to `routes/console.php`:
```php
// Fetch news for popular stocks every 2 hours during market hours
Schedule::command('news:fetch-popular-stocks')
    ->weekdays()
    ->cron('0 */2 * * *')
    ->between('9:00', '18:00')
    ->timezone('America/New_York')
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->description('Fetch news for popular stocks');

// Fetch news after market close
Schedule::command('news:fetch-all-stocks')
    ->weekdays()
    ->dailyAt('16:30')
    ->timezone('America/New_York')
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->description('Fetch news for all stocks after market close');
```

## üìä Database Schema

### news_articles table
```sql
- id: bigint (PK)
- stock_id: bigint (FK to stocks) ‚úÖ
- title: varchar(255)
- description: text
- url: varchar(255) UNIQUE
- image_url: varchar(255)
- source: varchar(100)
- published_at: timestamp ‚úÖ
- sentiment_score: decimal(5,4) ‚úÖ
- sentiment_label: varchar(20)
- is_important: boolean
- importance_date: date
- expected_surge_percent: decimal(5,2)
- surge_keywords: json
- created_at: timestamp
- updated_at: timestamp
```

## üîÑ Data Flow

### News Fetching & Storage Flow:
```
1. FetchNewsArticlesJob dispatched (manual or scheduled)
   ‚Üì
2. NewsService.getStockNews(symbol) - Fetches from APIs
   ‚Üì
3. NewsService.bulkStoreForStock(stock, articles) - Saves to DB
   ‚Üì
4. AnalyzeNewsSentimentJob dispatched (auto, 10s delay)
   ‚Üì
5. Keywords analyzed, sentiment_score calculated
   ‚Üì
6. Articles updated with sentiment scores
   ‚Üì
7. Prediction API queries today's news sentiment
   ‚Üì
8. Python model factors in news sentiment (TODO)
   ‚Üì
9. Frontend displays detailed breakdown (TODO)
```

## üéØ Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **HIGH**: Integrate today's news sentiment into Python prediction model
2. **HIGH**: Test end-to-end flow with multiple stocks
3. **MEDIUM**: Enhance PredictionCardV2 with news + technical breakdown
4. **MEDIUM**: Add scheduled news fetching for all popular stocks
5. **LOW**: Add news article caching and cleanup (delete old articles >30 days)

## üìù Testing Commands

```powershell
# Fetch news for AVGO
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/stocks/AVGO/news/fetch" -Method POST

# Get today's news with sentiment
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/stocks/AVGO/news/today"

# Get recent news (7 days)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/stocks/AVGO/news?days=7&limit=20"

# Generate prediction (should include news sentiment once integrated)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/predictions/AVGO"

# Check database
docker exec market-prediction-mysql mysql -u root -proot_password market_prediction -e "SELECT title, sentiment_score, published_at FROM news_articles WHERE stock_id = (SELECT id FROM stocks WHERE symbol='AVGO') ORDER BY published_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

## üéâ Summary

**Completed:** News storage system with sentiment analysis is fully functional and tested
**Remaining:** Integration into prediction scoring + frontend display enhancements
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for prediction integration + 3-4 hours for frontend
