# Quick Model V3 - Advanced Correction Detection

## Overview

Quick Model V3 is an enhanced stock prediction model featuring comprehensive **correction pattern detection**. It analyzes 8 different correction patterns to identify when stocks are likely to correct (mean revert), providing actionable alerts with severity levels.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **8 Correction Patterns**
1. **Parabolic Rise + Overbought RSI** (CRITICAL)
   - Triggers: Price up >12% (7d) + RSI >75
   - Indicates: Unsustainable rally, correction likely

2. **Extreme Deviation from Moving Averages**
   - Triggers: Price >8% above EMA12 or >10% above EMA26
   - Indicates: Mean reversion to moving averages expected

3. **Bollinger Band Breakout Exhaustion**
   - Triggers: Price >2.0 std devs above mean
   - Indicates: Extreme overbought, reversion to middle band

4. **Bearish Divergence**
   - Triggers: Price rising but RSI weakening
   - Indicates: Momentum loss, correction ahead

5. **Volume Exhaustion at Highs**
   - Triggers: Price up >8% (7d) with declining volume
   - Indicates: Lack of support, weakness

6. **Extended Rally (Too Far, Too Fast)**
   - Triggers: Price up >8% (3d) and >15% (7d)
   - Indicates: Unsustainable pace, pause/pullback expected

7. **Mean Reversion Trigger**
   - Triggers: 3+ indicators (RSI, BB, MA deviation, price surge)
   - Indicates: Multiple signals suggest pullback imminent

8. **Volatility Spike Pattern**
   - Triggers: High volatility + overbought + extended gains
   - Indicates: Increased volatility precedes reversals

### 2. **Inverse Pattern: Oversold Correction (Upward)**
- Triggers: Price down >10% (7d) + RSI <30
- Indicates: **BULLISH** - Upward bounce expected

---

## Correction Scoring

- **Score**: 0-100 scale indicating correction probability
- **Direction**: UP (bullish correction) or DOWN (bearish correction)
- **Severity**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Score Range | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **CRITICAL** | 80-100 | Take Profits / Short immediately |
| **HIGH** | 60-80 | Reduce Position / Tighten Stops |
| **MEDIUM** | 40-60 | Caution / Monitor Closely |
| **LOW** | 20-40 | Watch / Minor Overbought |

---

## Prediction Adjustment

V3 automatically adjusts predictions based on correction warnings:

### Downward Correction Detected
- If model says **BULLISH** but correction score >40:
  - Reduces bullish confidence by up to 50%
  - Higher correction score = stronger adjustment

### Upward Correction Detected  
- If model says **BEARISH** but oversold score >60:
  - **FLIPS to BULLISH** (strong oversold bounce expected)
- If oversold score 40-60:
  - Reduces bearish confidence by up to 40%

## Integration with Backend

### Update PredictionService.php

Change the Python model path:
```php
// In getPredictionForHorizon method
$pythonPath = base_path('python/models/quick_model_v3.py');
```

---

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Overbought Tech Stock
```
Input:
- Price: +18% (7d)
- RSI: 84
- BB Position: 2.3 std devs above mean
- Volume: Declining

Output:
- Correction Score: 75/100
- Direction: DOWN
- Severity: HIGH
- Patterns: 4 detected
- Action: "REDUCE POSITION - High correction risk"
- Adjusted Prediction: BULLISH ‚Üí NEUTRAL (confidence reduced 35%)
```

### Scenario 2: Oversold Value Stock
```
Input:
- Price: -12% (7d)
- RSI: 28
- News Sentiment: Neutral
- Volume: Increasing

Output:
- Correction Score: 68/100
- Direction: UP
- Severity: HIGH
- Action: "STRONG BUY - Extreme oversold, high probability bounce"
- Adjusted Prediction: BEARISH ‚Üí BULLISH (flipped!)
```

### Scenario 3: Normal Conditions
```
Input:
- Price: +3% (7d)
- RSI: 58
- BB Position: 0.6 (middle band)
- Volume: Average

Output:
- Correction Score: 0
- Direction: NONE
- No adjustment to prediction
```

## Alerts in Frontend

The correction warnings should be displayed prominently in the prediction card:

### Display Logic

```javascript
if (correctionWarning.warning) {
  const { severity, direction, recommended_action, patterns } = correctionWarning;
  
  // Show alert badge
  if (direction === 'DOWN') {
    // Show red/orange warning
    <Badge color="warning">‚ö†Ô∏è Correction Risk: {severity}</Badge>
    <Text>{recommended_action}</Text>
  } else if (direction === 'UP') {
    // Show green opportunity
    <Badge color="success">‚úÖ Oversold Opportunity</Badge>
    <Text>{recommended_action}</Text>
  }
  
  // List detected patterns
  patterns.map(p => (
    <ListItem>
      <Text>{p.reason}</Text>
      <Text>Action: {p.action}</Text>
    </ListItem>
  ))
}
```
