# Sector-Aware Volatility Predictions - Implementation Fix

## Date: October 14, 2025

## Problem Summary

The stock prediction system was consistently returning fallback model predictions with unrealistic small percentage moves (0.5-0.8%) for high-volatility tech stocks like AVGO, NVDA, and TSLA, despite having volatility multipliers configured in the database.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Feature Validation Stripping Metadata**: The Python model's `_validate_features()` method was only preserving features that were in the predefined feature lists (`base_features`, `asian_features`, `european_features`). The `volatility_multiplier` and `category` fields were being stripped out during validation, even though they were passed from the backend.

2. **Debug Print Contaminating JSON Output**: Debug print statements to `stderr` were being captured by `shell_exec($command . ' 2>&1')` in PHP, contaminating the JSON response and causing parse errors. This resulted in the backend falling back to the simple `fallback_v1` model.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Preserve Metadata in Feature Validation

**File**: `backend/python/models/quick_model_v4.py`

**Change**: Modified `_validate_features()` method to preserve non-feature metadata:

```python
def _validate_features(self, features):
    """Validate and fill missing features"""
    validated = {}
    
    # Fill base features
    for feature in self.base_features:
        validated[feature] = features.get(feature, 0.0)
    
    # Fill Asian features
    for feature in self.asian_features:
        validated[feature] = features.get(feature, 0.0)
    
    # Fill European features
    for feature in self.european_features:
        validated[feature] = features.get(feature, 0.0)
    
    # CRITICAL: Preserve non-feature metadata like volatility_multiplier and category
    # These are used for sector-aware predictions but are NOT training features
    if 'volatility_multiplier' in features:
        validated['volatility_multiplier'] = features['volatility_multiplier']
    if 'category' in features:
        validated['category'] = features['category']
    if 'symbol' in features:
        validated['symbol'] = features['symbol']
    
    return validated
```

### 2. Remove Debug Print Statements

**File**: `backend/python/models/quick_model_v4.py`

**Change**: Removed all `print(f"DEBUG: ...")` statements that were writing to stderr and contaminating the JSON output.

**Before**:
```python
# DEBUG logging
print(f"DEBUG: base_magnitude={base_magnitude:.3f}, base_move={base_move:.3f}, volatility_multiplier={volatility_multiplier}, expected_move_before_min={expected_move:.3f}", file=sys.stderr)

# ENFORCE minimum 2% for tech mega-caps (multiplier >= 1.5)
if volatility_multiplier >= 1.5 and abs(expected_move) < 2.0:
    print(f"DEBUG: Applying minimum 2% (was {expected_move:.3f})", file=sys.stderr)
    expected_move = 2.0
```

**After**:
```python
# ENFORCE minimum 2% for tech mega-caps (multiplier >= 1.5)
# This ensures tech giants always have realistic volatile predictions
if volatility_multiplier >= 1.5 and abs(expected_move) < 2.0:
    expected_move = 2.0  # Minimum 2% magnitude
```

## Results

### Before Fix
- Model: `fallback_v1`
- AVGO expected move: 0.68%
- NVDA expected move: ~0.5%
- TSLA expected move: ~0.5%

### After Fix
- Model: `quick_model_v4`
- AVGO (1.80x multiplier): -2.38% ✅
- NVDA (2.00x multiplier): -2.70% ✅
- TSLA (2.50x multiplier): -3.25% ✅
- JPM (1.30x multiplier): -1.72% ✅
- JNJ (1.00x multiplier): -2.09% ✅

## Current Volatility Multipliers

| Symbol | Category | Volatility Multiplier | Sample Prediction |
|--------|----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| TSLA   | Technology | 2.50x | -3.25% |
| NVDA   | Technology | 2.00x | -2.70% |
| AVGO   | Technology | 1.80x | -2.38% |
| AAPL   | Technology | 1.50x | TBD |
| MSFT   | Technology | 1.50x | TBD |
| JPM    | Finance | 1.30x | -1.72% |
| JNJ    | Healthcare | 1.00x | -2.09% |

## Verification Steps

1. Deleted all predictions for test stocks
2. Cleared Redis cache
3. Restarted PHP-FPM container
4. Generated fresh predictions via API
5. Confirmed `quick_model_v4` is being used
6. Verified predictions show realistic volatility-adjusted percentage moves

## Key Learnings

1. **Shell Output Handling**: When capturing Python script output via `shell_exec($command . ' 2>&1')`, ALL output (stdout + stderr) is captured. Debug logging to stderr will contaminate JSON responses.

2. **Feature Validation**: When passing metadata that isn't part of the training features (like `volatility_multiplier`, `category`), ensure it's explicitly preserved through the validation pipeline.

3. **Minimum Thresholds**: For high-volatility stocks (multiplier >= 1.5), enforce minimum 2% expected moves to avoid unrealistically small predictions even with weak signals.

## Files Modified

1. `backend/python/models/quick_model_v4.py`
   - Modified `_validate_features()` to preserve metadata
   - Removed debug print statements from `_calculate_expected_move()`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Python model now correctly applies volatility multipliers
2. ✅ Backend passes category and volatility data correctly
3. ✅ Predictions are realistic and sector-aware
4. ⏭️ Frontend display verification (check PredictionCardV2 component)
5. ⏭️ Ensure target prices are calculated from current price, not previous close

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The sector-aware volatility prediction system is now fully operational and producing realistic, varied predictions based on stock category and market conditions.
